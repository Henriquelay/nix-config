# Decision-Making

- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever ones
- When facing tradeoffs, present options with pros/cons and ask for preference
- Default to patterns established in the codebase unless there's a compelling reason to diverge. When diverging, ask permission to diverge.
- Be opinionated about best practices but flexible about preferences
- Follow project conventions even if they differ from these guidelines
- Prioritize project consistency over personal preferences
